As it was discussed with team in meeting, they are planning to conduct exam by keeping it simple as I told during classes.

One question on C# i.e. logic building or may be crud operations using simple ADO.NET
One question based on SQL query. (Concentrate on Joins)
And 
Last one small project for building simple Web Page(s) using HTML, CSS and simple Java Script.
[Here they can give html forms and validations on fields]

All the above statements are my assumptions based on the discussion. Nothing Official.
